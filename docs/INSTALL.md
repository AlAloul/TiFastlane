Before you install make sure you follow the instructions on this guide to make sure you have all the requirements.

Requirements:

* Mac OS 10.9 or newer
* Ruby 2.0 or newer (`ruby -v`)
* Xcode
* Fastlane Tools

**Xcode**

Additionally to your Xcode installation, you also need the Xcode command line tools set up.

    xcode-select --install

**Fastlane**

You need to install the Fastlane tools which are Ruby Gems. You can install all the toolset by running:
